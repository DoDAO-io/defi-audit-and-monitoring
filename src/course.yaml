  Smart contract auditing is the process of reviewing and testing the source
  code of a smart contract to identify any potential vulnerabilities or security
  issues. This can include checking for errors in the code, evaluating the
  contract's overall design and architecture, and testing the contract's
  functionality to ensure that it performs as intended. The goal of a smart
  contract audit is to ensure that the contract is secure and reliable, and that
  it will function as intended when deployed on a blockchain network.
