##### What is rewarded to successful scan nodes?  

- [ ]  Resources like ethereum
- [x]  FORT tokens
- [ ]  No rewards
- [ ]  500 usd annually
  
Hint: Scan nodes
         
Explanation: Successful scan nodes are rewarded with FORT tokens. The amount of token depends on their SLA.

##### What component of Forta will authenticate and validate the scan nodes?  

- [ ]  Forta Admin
- [ ]  Scanner Nodes
- [x]  Analyzer
- [ ]  Assigner
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Analyzer will authenticate and validate the scan nodes. It will trigger alerts according to the findings from the scan nodes.

##### Why each detection bot is connected to six nodes?  

- [x]  To maintain consensus
- [x]  To get data availability
- [ ]  To decrease the gas cost
- [ ]  To incentivize the subscribers
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Every detection bots will run on six scan nodes meaning each bot will get the data from six scan nodes. This is done to maintain consensus security and availability of nodes.

##### What is the function of Assigner?  

- [ ]  It will authorize the nodes and triggers alerts from the findings
- [ ]  It will scan the blockchain
- [ ]  It will search for bugs in the code
- [x]  It will assign and deassigns scanner nodes and detection bots
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: The Assigner will assigns and deassigns the scanner nodes and detection bots. It is currently centralized.

##### Why detection bots and scanner nodes should stake FORT tokens?  

- [x]  To prevent malicious activity
- [ ]  To make profit to the protocol
- [ ]  To generate interest
- [ ]  None of these
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Detection bot and scanner nodes should stake FORT tokens to prevent malicious activities.

##### In which function in the detection bot we should implement the logic to detect threats?  

- [x]  handleTransaction
- [ ]  tetherTransferEvents
- [x]  handleBlock
- [ ]  FindingType
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: The custom logic to detect threats is to be implemented in handleTransaction and handleBlock functions.

##### How scanner node will send findings to the Analyzer?  

- [ ]  By storing data in the blockchain
- [x]  Using the Private API of Analyzer
- [ ]  Only detection bot will send the findings to Analyzer
- [ ]  By sending findings to the Assigner
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Scanner node will make a API call to send findings to the Analyzer.
